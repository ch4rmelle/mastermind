# Mastermind
Play a codebreaking challenge! As a player you can choose to be a code-breaker
to guess a computer's secret code OR have the computer guess your secret code.

This project is implemented from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-mastermind)
The computer solver uses [Swaszek's Algorithm](https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/8884) where it will
solve the secret code in 5 turns or less.
